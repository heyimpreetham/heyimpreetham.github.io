  <h1>The Journey through life</span></strong></h1><h1 style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size:19px;line-height:107%;">Life is not just a word. In fact almost no one know the meaning of what exactly life is. But as a common thought among people we knew life is just to be lived. We come across quotes and sayings of great people who already lived their times. Yet they only have a perception of their very own life. To be precise, the path of a person who succeeded in his life will be different from the path of another person who had also succeeded in his life. Some people follow the path of great people or take them as an inspiration and end up succeeded in the same way as their idols did. These ideologies definitely take no offences. But, mankind always follow a kind of routine through ages. The routine is that as soon as you are born you go to school, you learn what the education system formulates, you form up grades, you finish up your learning after gaining a badge, you go for a job, you get married, you will have kids then, you make the kids follow the same routine, you invest a lot on various things for them, you say goodbye to the younger generation, you die and finally only your body rests somewhere under the mud but your soul will never rest in peace. Because your soul might had never been in real peace while you were living. You live your life with a lot of negative influences and attributes around and also within you such as agony, jealous, hatred and being adamant. These influences had never been there when there you are so young. You have all these when you make yourself to socialize. Of course, these negative elements will take over your thoughts as they are inevitable. But to live peacefully you have tackle those in a proper way. When speaking of the routine which I said earlier, have you ever thought of a life plan formulated only by you? Yes, you must have your own version of life. It&rsquo;s not necessary to follow the same routine but instead you can make a new better life. You have to realize that you must always think to bring out a positive outcome in future for you and the people are depending on you even if the choices that you have made had led to the wrong side at present. People run behind fame and money. We have seen many people who is so rich but die in an unfortunate way too soon. But we have also seen people who has a little wealth and die peacefully with a better conscious even at an age more than a century. All you have to do is balance only the good weights. It&rsquo;s neither the fame nor the money that drives you peacefully to live, it&rsquo;s always the duality of heart and mind. Everything happens the way you think when you extend your heart and mind to accept mistakes and correct them. Never hesitate to learn things. Think of a way to reduce chaos around you. Teach good qualities to others. Be as humble as you can. Be grateful. I believe true success is being a better human-being in an entire life span. It is all about survival at the end. I ask all of you SURVIVE BETTER.</span></h1>
